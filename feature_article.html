                <p>Nearly every major news outlet in Canada prints some form of a bestseller list, highlighting the most popular books at a moment in time.</p> 
                <p>Yet academics, publishers and even the media organisations that print bestseller lists acknowledge they are flawed at best and a marketing gimmick at worst.</p> 
                <p>"The lists themselves are a little bit opaque," says Danielle Fuller, a professor at the University of Alberta. "The patterns over 23 years may be more telling."</p> 
                <p>So other than a grain of salt, what trends can readers take away from the <em>Toronto Star</em> bestseller lists of the millennium so far?</p>

                    <p>Gladwell may have grown up in Elmira, Ontario, but his long-standing appeal to international audiences – particularly readers south of the border – helps to explain his decades of chart dominance, experts say.</p>
                    <p>"The literary industries of the United States are extremely powerful," says Julie Rak, a non-fiction literary specialist and professor at the University of Alberta. "If you have a best-selling book from the <em>New York Times</em>, you have cultural credibility."</p>
                    <p>After his first book, <em>The Tipping Point</em> (2000) became a <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, Gladwell quickly developed brand recognition in the U.S., making it much more likely his work would get noticed by readers at home and abroad.</p>

                <p>Canada Reads – the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's annual "battle of the books" broadcast program – has been affecting national bestseller lists since it started in 2002.</p>
                <p>"From the minute it went on the air, everybody glommed onto it," says Talin Vartanian, the original creator of the <em>Survivor</em>-style radio and television show that sees five high-profile Canadians debate why their book of choice should win the competition.</p>
                <p>"There's a real synergy between CBC radio listeners and readers. Many of our listeners are avid readers."</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!-- Split content between two columns -->
        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-lg-6 col-12">
                <p>In the original pitch, Vartanian aimed to create a show that would, among other objectives, "celebrate Canadian writing" and "forge a bond between younger and older readers." But even she has been shocked by Canada Reads' ability to bridge time and generations.</p>
                <p><em>Rockbound</em>, Frank Parker Day’s 1928 novel about feuding families in a remote Nova Scotia fishing community, won the competition in 2005. As a result, post-Y2K Canadians rushed out to buy the book 77 years after it was first published.</p>
                <p>"That was a delightful surprise," said Vartanian. "It was also great to see a title that, honestly, I'd never heard of – so few people had heard about – shoot to the top of the bestseller list."</p>
                <p>Rockbound's surprise success was a shock for its publisher, the University of Toronto Press. Since winning the program, the once out-of-print novel has been <a href="https://utorontopress.com/9781442690639/rockbound/">reprinted three times.</a></p>

            <div class="col-12">
                <p>Now Vartanian says publishers expect the "Canada Reads bump" and prepare accordingly.</p>
                <p>"All the books got noticed, not just the winning book," she says. "The publisher needs some warning that this book is going to be in contention. If you don't have them available you're going to be in deep doo-doo." </p>

                <h2>Women lead fiction list as non-fiction 'gender gap' persists</h2>
                <p>For two decades, women have consistently claimed the majority of spots on the <em>Star's</em> fiction bestseller lists. Of Canadian authors, six out of every 10 fiction bestsellers so far this century were written by women.</p>
                <p>Women – and white women in particular – have long been some of Canada's leading voices in fiction, says Gillian Roberts, Canadian literature professor at the University of Nottingham.</p>
                <p>"If we think about the dominant [authors] internationally, we think about Alice Munro and Margaret Atwood," she says.</p>
                <p>But non-fiction tells a very different story, with books written solely by men making up more than two thirds of the bestseller lists over the past 23 years.</p>
                <p>"There is absolutely a gender gap," says Rak.</p>
                <p>And that gap has closed very little.</p>
                <p>Women wrote less than one in three of the non-fiction bestsellers in 2000. In 2023, this rate is completely unchanged.</p>
                <p>Rak says the big publishing houses "are not necessarily publishing people from diverse backgrounds and work by women, as much as you would think they would."</p>
                <p>In 2021, Joshua Whitehead became the first Two-Spirit author to appear on the fiction bestseller list, and last year actor Elliot Page became the first transgender author on the <em>Star's</em> non-fiction charts.</p>
                <p>Stephanie Sinclair, publisher at McClelland & Stewart, says broadening the non-fiction space is "one of our priorities."</p>
                <p>"We've really been making a concerted effort to make sure that we are creating more space for authors who aren't cis, white men," she said. "But more importantly than who the authors are, it's what the books are, when the books are offering a perspective that we need to see more."</p>
                <p>McClelland & Stewart has had the greatest number of bestseller list appearances across fiction and non-fiction compared to any other Canadian publisher, largely driven by leading women writers.</p>
                <p>While the gender gap in non-fiction list may be closing at McClelland & Stewart, time will tell whether other publishers promote books by gender-diverse authors onto the bestseller list this year.</p>
                <p>"It seems ridiculous to me that that's still the case in 2024," says Fuller. "It doesn't really feel like it should be that way anymore."</p>

                <h2>Indigenous representation slowly increases, then decreases</h2>
                <p>Indigenous authors – who have traditionally been under-represented in Canada's mainstream publishing industry – saw a notable increase in bestseller list appearances at the start of the decade.</p>
                <p>In 2021, a quarter of all Canadian fiction and non-fiction titles on the <em>Toronto Star</em> bestseller list were written by Indigenous authors.</p>
                <p>That year, <em>Jonny Appleseed</em> by Joshua Whitehead won Canada Reads as non-fiction titles like <em>Indian in the Cabinet</em> by Jody Wilson-Raybould and <em>Seven Fallen Feathers</em> by Tanya Talaga featured on Canadians' bookshelves.</p>
                <p>Daniel Justice, an Indigenous literature professor at the University of British Columbia and member of the Cherokee Nation, says the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) – a government agency established to document the history of the residential school system – likely affected book-buying over this period.</p>
                <p>"I think the TRC made a huge difference," he said. "There's an opening to engage Indigenous histories and Indigenous voices ... I think we see an audience that's much more curious."</p>
                <p>"I don't know that we're ever going to be at the centre of the bestsellers in the same way as around the TRC."</p>
                <p>Indigenous representation on the bestseller list begins to trend upward in 2017. In December 2016, the <a href="https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/author-joseph-boydens-shape-shifting-indigenous-identity/">Aboriginal Peoples Television Network reported</a> that author Joseph Boyden had misrepresented his ancestry.</p>
                <p>At the height of his career, Boyden was considered one of the most prominent Indigenous writers in Canada, appearing on the <em>Toronto Star's</em> bestseller list five times between 2008 and 2016 – more than any other single Indigenous-identified author.</p>
                <p>"Part of the reason I think Boyden was so popular was because he told the expected story of Indigenous dysfunction and deficiency," says Justice. "He could write stereotypes in ways that were very palatable to a mainstream white Canadian audience."</p>
                <p>Before the revelations, Boyden was the only Indigenous-identified author to appear on the fiction bestseller list.</p>
                <p>"He was ruthless in the way he took up space," says Justice. "Every platform he was given, he stepped on."</p>
                <p>Since a peak in 2021, the number of appearances by Indigenous writers on the bestseller list is dropping. And publishers are taking notice.</p>
                <p>"There was this wave of people looking for Indigenous storytellers in and around 2020 through to 2023," said Sinclair, who is Cree and Ojibwe. "Now it feels like that is beginning to wane a little bit."</p>
                <p>"As a reader and as a publishing professional, I think it is not only important to find these stories and amplify them and share them," says Anita Chong, executive editor at McClelland & Stewart. "I think it's for the good of our literature ... for the readers of this country."</p>
                <p>There will always be ebbs and flows on the bestseller lists, but Justice encourages readers to seek out emerging writers via the <a href="https://indigenousvoicesawards.org/home-page">Indigenous Voices Awards</a>, which has amplified work by Billy-Ray Belcourt, Alicia Elliott and Smokii Sumac, among others.</p>

                <h2>Bringing poetry to the mainstream</h2>
                <p>Poetry doesn't tend to have much of a presence on mainstream bestseller lists, which are largely separated into fiction and non-fiction categories. The genre has a smaller audience that isn't typically reflected in the rankings.</p>
                <p>That is, until Rupi Kaur began to take over the charts in 2016. </p>
                <p>"What Rupi Kaur did is make poetry accessible," says Lesley Fletcher, executive director with the League of Canadian Poets. "She really hit her stride making poetry simple, using it to describe universal experiences – or near-universal experiences – and making it very sharable."</p>
                <p>So sharable, in fact, that Fletcher says she has "absolutely" noticed a spike in interest around poetry since Kaur's debut. At the same time, the league's membership has more than doubled since 2016.</p>
                <p>"She made fans for herself, but she also made fans for other poetry."</p>

                <p>Bestseller lists, like other economic measures, do not exist in a vacuum.</p>
                <p>When a book is adapted for film or television, it often sees new print runs and sprints back up the charts in a second wind.</p>
                <p>"Nothing happens in isolation," says Rak.</p>
                <p>Margaret Atwood's 1985 novel <em>The Handmaid's Tale</em> was not a runaway bestseller at the time of publication. Yet most Canadians consider it a modern classic, and it appeared eight times on the <em>Star's</em> list between 2017 and 2022 – more than any other fiction title over the period.</p>

                <p>"<em>The Handmaid's Tale</em> was not a big deal when it came out, and Canadians did not read it," says Rak. </p>
                <p>In 2017, it was adapted for television by U.S. streaming service Hulu, the same year Atwood's 1996 novel <em>Alias Grace</em> returned to the bestseller list thanks to a miniseries.</p>
                <p>"<em>The Handmaid's Tale</em> is a very interesting example because it's a series," says Roberts. "It carries on the story."</p>
                <p>The series' most recent season aired in 2022, with the book dropping off the list in 2023 after five years. It will likely return when the <a href="https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/the-handmaids-tale-season-6-what-to-know-about-the-final-season/">final season airs in 2025.</a></p>

            <p>"Although people who have read the texts will go see the film, more people will see these films than have read the text previously," says Roberts. "New readers are generated from that experience."</p>

            <h2>Beware of bestseller lists</h2>
            <p>Readers may want to know what Canadians are buying, but Rak warns that "bestseller lists are not objective measures," and that they tell a story somewhere between fact and fiction.</p>
            <p><em>The Toronto Star's</em> bestseller lists largely come from <a href="https://www.booknetcanada.ca/salesdata/">BookNet Canada</a>, a non-profit organisation that aggregates weekly English-language print book sales data from more than 2,000 shops across the country. The non-profit says the data covers 85 per cent of the market, but retailers surveyed are not named and raw sales figures are not available to the public.</p>
            <p>"I would always be very careful to read into a bestseller list, because sometimes publishers spend a lot of marketing dollars making sure that their book gets on the list quickly," says Fuller. "If you know anything about how those lists are made up, you're immediately cynical."</p>
            <p>Justice agrees, adding the value of a book goes far beyond a bestseller label on the cover.</p>
            <p>"I think the healthiest response has always been scepticism of colonial approval, and bestseller lists are certainly part of that," he says.</p>
            <p>Publisher McClelland & Stewart says it is more focused on maintaining a "sweet spot," balancing established authors and emerging writers who will line future bookshelves.</p>
            <p>"It is all about investing in the longer career of a writer," says Chong.</p>
            <p>There was a time, Chong says, when Michael Ondaatje – one of Canada's most celebrated authors – was an experimental writer and risky investment. Yet, the publisher took a chance and watched him, and other authors like him, "become these bright lights."</p>
            <p>While largely opaque, readers can use bestseller lists to find their next favourite book – as long as they don't put too much stock into the rankings.</p>
            <p>"There are all these industry tricks at play," says Fuller. "We have to take it with a pinch of salt."</p>
