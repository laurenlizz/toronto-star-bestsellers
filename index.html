            <p>Readers across the country are diversifying their taste in Canadian literature, according to the <em>Toronto Star</em> bestseller lists over the last two decades, although they continue to buy books by the nation's most established writers.</p>

            <p>Over more than two decades, Canada's bestselling bookshelf has clearly evolved, slowly lining its ledges with a more diverse range of voices since 2000.</p>
            <p>But as literature experts and publishing professionals warn, bestseller lists are simply an economic snapshot of Canada's wider bookshelf. The shelves above offer a story that lies somewhere between fact and fiction.</p>
            <p>Behind the bookshelf, a few key trends can help contextualise what Canadians are buying – from the Canada Reads bump to increasing Indigenous representation. <b><a href="{{ url_for('feature_article') }}">Click over to the feature story</a> to crack the spine and read on.</b></p>

    2000: `
        <p>Some of Canada's most prominent authors make up a bulk of the bestseller lists at the turn of the millennium, including Malcolm Gladwell, Margaret Atwood, Michael Ondaatje, and Naomi Klein. SPOILER ALERT: As you scroll, these authors will largely continue to dominate through to 2023.</p>
    `,
    2002: `
        <p>Canada Reads debuted as a radio program in 2002, bringing older works like Michael Ondaatje's <em>In the Skin of a Lion</em> (1987) and Rohinton Mistry's <em>A Fine Balance</em> (1995) back to the top of the bestseller list.</p>
    `,
    2004: `
        <p>From 2004 onward, Canadian women began to appear on the fiction bestseller lists more frequently than men. Since 2000, women make up 60% of the fiction bestseller list.</p>
        <p>However, the non-fiction list continues to be dominated by men. Between 2000 to 2023, 70% of all non-fiction books were written solely by men, highlighting an ongoing gender gap in the category.</p>
    `,
    2005: `
        <p>Nearly a century after it was first published, <em>Rockbound</em> (1928) by Frank Parker Day wins Canada Reads and returns to the bestseller list in 2005.</p>
    `,
    2007: "<p>This year has the lowest number of Canadian authors on the bestseller list, because the <em>Toronto Star</em> highlighted only 50 books (25 fiction and 25 non-fiction) in its year-end bestseller list. Before and after this year, the bestseller list is a 100-book ranking, inclusive of international authors.</p>",
    2008: "<p>The vast majority of the books on this shelf are non-fiction, as Canadian fiction writers were largely outnumbered by international authors on the fiction bestseller list. Here we see multiple appearances by our biggest non-fiction heavy-hitters, Malcolm Gladwell and Naomi Klein. In a rare non-fiction appearance, Margaret Atwood also charts with <em>Payback: Debt and the Shadow Side of Wealth.</em></p>",
    2009: `
        <p>Canadian celebrities storm the non-fiction bestseller list with well-received memoirs: <em>Playing with Fire</em> by former NHLer Theo Fleury and Kirstie McLellan Day, <em>Don Cherry's Hockey Stories and Stuff</em> by Don Cherry and Al Strachan, and <em>Always Looking Up</em> by Michael J. Fox. Fleury's appearance marks the first entry by an Indigenous author on the list.</p>
        <p><em>The Book of Negroes</em> by Lawrence Hill wins Canada Reads.</p>
    `,
    2011: `
        <p>Four of Malcolm Gladwell's books appear on the bestseller list this year – a record for a Canadian author since 2000.</p>
    `,
    2012: `
        <p>In the wake of the Arab Spring movement, non-fiction books like <em>A Thousand Farewells: A Reporter's Journey from Refugee Camp to the Arab Spring</em> by Nahlah Ayed ranks for the first time, and <em>The Prisoner of Tehran</em> by Marina Nemat returns to the charts.</p>
        <p>A decade after it first hit the shelves, <em>Life of Pi</em> (2001) by Yann Martel returns to the bestseller list thanks to a 2012 film adaptation.</p>
    `,
    2013: "<p>This year, the bestseller list features then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper with a book about early 20th-century professional hockey: <em>A Great Game: The Forgotten Leafs and the Rise of Professional Hockey.</em></p>",
    2014: "<p>Alice Munro wins the Nobel Prize for Literature in 2013 – the first and only Canadian author to do so to date. Although she has been a mainstay on the bestseller list since the start of the millennium, two thirds of all fiction books on the list this year are Munro short story collections.</p>",
    2015: `
        <p>Lawrence Hill's novel <em>The Book of Negroes</em> (2007) returns to the No. 1 spot on the bestseller list, following the release of a 2015 miniseries.</p>
        <p>In non-fiction, <em>The Inconvenient Indian</em> by Thomas King takes the top spot after being featured on Canada Reads. In late 2015, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada presented its final report on fostering reconciliation between Indigenous peoples and settler Canadians.</p>
    `,
    2016: `
        <p>Poet Rupi Kaur appears on the bestseller list for the first time. In less than a decade, she will amass the third most appearances on the bestseller list - behind only Malcolm Gladwell and Margaret Atwood.</p>
        <p>Joseph Boyden appears on the list for the last time, following an <a href="https://www.aptnnews.ca/national-news/author-joseph-boydens-shape-shifting-indigenous-identity/" target="_blank">APTN investigation</a> into his claims of Indigenous ancestry. Before the revelations that he misrepresented his identity, Boyden had every fiction list appearance attributed to Indigenous authors between 2000-2016.</p>
    `,
    2017: `
        <p><em>The Handmaid's Tale</em> (1985) by Margaret Atwood hits the bestseller list after more than three decades, thanks to a popular television adaptation. Also this year, Atwood's <em>Alias Grace</em> becomes a Netflix miniseries, bringing her 1996 novel back to the charts.</p>
    `,
    2019: "<p>This is the first year that <em>21 Things You May Not Know About the Indian Act</em> by Bob Joseph appears on the bestseller list. The book will consistently appear on the bookshelf until the end of the timeline in 2023.</p>",
    2020: "<p>This is the only year across the timeline where the entire fiction list is comprised of books written by women.</p>",
    2021: `
        <p>Joshua Whitehead's novel <em>Jonny Appleseed</em> wins Canada Reads, making Whitehead the only Two-Spirit author to appear on the list between 2000 and 2023. Indigenous authors comprise a quarter of all bestseller appearances this year, including <em>Indian in the Cabinet</em> by Jody Wilson-Raybould, <em>The Marrow Thieves</em> by Cherie Dimaline and <em>Seven Fallen Feathers</em> by Tanya Talaga.</p>
        <p>This year also sees the greatest representation of racialised authors on the bookshelf, with about 43% of all bestseller list appearances. However, the following years see this representation greatly reduced, dropping down to 20% in 2023 – an underrepresentation for the <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/221026/dq221026b-eng.htm" target="_blank"> quarter of all Canadians</a> who are racialised.</p>
    `,
    2022: "<p><em>Five Little Indians</em> by Michelle Good wins Canada Reads in 2022, putting it at the top spot on the list. Meanwhile, U.S. politician Hillary Rodham Clinton makes a random appearance with <em>State of Terror</em>, a novel co-written by Canadian Louise Penny.</p>",
    2023: "<p>Celebrity memoirs dominated Canadian charts this year, with <em>Pageboy</em> by Elliot Page, <em>Love, Pamela</em> by Pamela Anderson, <em>My Effin' Life</em> by Rush's Geddy Lee, and <em>Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing</em> by the late Matthew Perry. Outside of Canadian authors, <em>Spare</em> by Prince Harry was the top-selling book across the country in 2023 – reinforcing the celebrity memoir's prominent spot on the bookshelf.</p>",
